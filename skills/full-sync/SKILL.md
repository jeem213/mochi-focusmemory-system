# Full Sync - Complete System Synchronization

This skill performs a complete synchronization combining ALL memory operations. It's the most comprehensive sync available.

## When to Use This Skill

Triggered when the user says:
- "full sync"
- "sync everything"
- "complete sync"
- "full system sync"

---

## The Full Sync Process (14 Steps)

### Step 0: REVIEW AUTO-LEARNED MEMORY (NEW!)

**Auto Memory System - Learn Automatically!**

Read `memory/auto-learned.md` and:
1. Check for new learnings since last full-sync
2. Identify items that should be promoted to permanent.md
3. Note any items to mention in final report
4. Tag promoted items with #auto-learned

### Step 0b: CHECK IMPROVEMENTS (NEW!)

**1% Better Feature Check!**

Check `memory/improvements/` folder:
1. Read `1percent-better-counter.md` - check current session count
2. Note progress toward next 1% Better prompt (every 5 sessions)
3. If counter at 5+, note that prompt is due soon

### Step 1: HINDSIGHT HEALTH CHECK (18-Point)

Run full 18-point check using `skills/study/SKILL.md`:
- Health, Version, Bank, Profile, Config
- Directives, Memories, Entities, Mental Models
- Documents, Tags, Graph, Stats, Operations
- Recall test, RUN REFLECT, ENTITY TIMELINE, CONSOLIDATION CHECK

**API Base:** `https://glutinous-meda-excrescently.ngrok-free.dev`

### Step 2: DIRECTIVES

Query Hindsight for active rules:
```bash
curl -s https://glutinous-meda-excrescently.ngrok-free.dev/v1/default/banks/default/directives
```
Extract:
- Voice preferences (Jeem=Onyx/Will, Sara=Davis)
- Communication style
- Memory protocol
- Birthday awareness

### Step 3: REFLECT

Trigger Hindsight to synthesize memories:
```bash
curl -s --max-time 90 -X POST https://glutinous-meda-excrescently.ngrok-free.dev/v1/default/banks/default/reflect \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is the current state of our system and partnership?"}'
```

### Step 4: INGEST

Read current GitHub state:
- README.md
- Config files
- Recent commits (last 10)
- Skills directory

```bash
git log --oneline -10
git status
```

### Step 5: RECALL

Call Hindsight for recent design discussions:
```bash
curl -s -X POST https://glutinous-meda-excrescently.ngrok-free.dev/v1/default/banks/default/memories/recall \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What design decisions have we made recently?"}'
```

### Step 6: CROSS-REFERENCE

Compare what's in memory vs what's in the code:
- Check if skills referenced in SOUL.md actually exist
- Verify trigger definitions match skill files
- Note any discrepancies

### Step 7: CRON STATUS

Check HEARTBEAT.md for scheduled tasks:
- backup_to_github: daily midnight (Saskatchewan)
- morning_update: daily 8am (Saskatchewan)
- sara_morning_update: daily 8:05am (Saskatchewan)
- tts_health_check: daily 6am (Saskatchewan)
- weekly_summary: Sunday 5pm (Saskatchewan)
- full_sync_morning: daily 8:30am (Saskatchewan)
- full_sync_evening: daily 8pm (Saskatchewan)

### Step 8: CHANGE DETECTION

Show what's new since last sync:
- New commits since last check
- New memories added
- New directives created
- Updated configurations

### Step 9: SYNC TIMESTAMPS

Track when each component last synced:
- Hindsight: timestamp
- GitHub: last push time
- Memory files: last update
- Cron jobs: last run

### Step 10: HEALTH SCORING

Rate overall system health (1-10):
| Component | Weight | Score |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Hindsight connectivity | 30% | /10 |
| GitHub sync status | 20% | /10 |
| Cron job success rate | 20% | /10 |
| Memory freshness | 15% | /10 |
| Directive currency | 15% | /10 |

**Overall:** Weighted average

### Step 11: SYNC VALIDATION

Verify key integrations still work:
- ✅ Test Hindsight connection
- ✅ Verify GitHub push works
- ✅ Check all channels (Discord, Telegram)
- ✅ Validate Notion API (if configured)
- Report any failures

### Step 12: CONFLICT DETECTION

Find contradictory information:
- Compare memory vs Hindsight facts
- Check code vs documentation consistency
- Flag stale information

### Step 13: OUTPUT COMPLETE REPORT

Present unified report:
- 🎯 Active directives (from Step 2)
- 🧠 Updated mental models (from Reflect)
- 📚 Codebase context (from Ingest)
- 📅 Cron/Schedule status (from Step 7)
- 🔄 Changes detected (from Step 8)
- ⏰ Sync timestamps (from Step 9)
- 📊 Health score (from Step 10)
- ⚠️ Any conflicts found

| Directives + Reflect | 2 min |
| GitHub Ingest | 30s |
| Recall | 30s |
| Cross-ref + Cron | 1 min |
| Validation | 1 min |
| **Total** | **~8-10 min** |
